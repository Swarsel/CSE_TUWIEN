\section{Libraries}

I tried to implement the dot product for all four libraries (they can be found in the respective 1a-1d files in the linked git repository). \\
Sadly I failed to produce working implementations for Thrust and ViennaCL; for Thrust, I got a very long error message that I was not able to handle:

\begin{tiny}

[...]
\end{verbatim}
\end{tiny}
For ViennaCL, I got this weird, seemingly HIP-related error:

\begin{tiny}
\begin{verbatim}

[...]
\end{verbatim}
\end{tiny}

I fear these errors arose because of some oversight on my part; however, I house a small hope that there might be something wrong with the remote host. This is because when I tried to run my CUDA dot product, I got another error. This code ran without issue for the last exercise, and all of the non-working libraries are using CUDA.

\begin{tiny}
\begin{verbatim}
In file included from e1fb6cf3.cu:1:
./cuda_errchk.hpp:4:35: error: unknown type name 'cudaError'

\end{verbatim}
\end{tiny}

\newpage
As for the comparison, this data shines a grim light, as both of these libraries are a lot slower than the OpenCL approach from last week (the Thrust, ViennaCL and CUDA implementations are omitted in the graph due to the above problems - however, I included a file csmca_1_all(broken).py that would theoretically perform a full benchmark for completeness). \\

I have the feeling that for the two libraries that I got to work (Boost and VexCL) I also made some mistake, it seems unlikely that these libraries perform so poorly for such a simple task. I wish I had more time to investigate this matter more, but due to a lot of projects being due I did not have the time to do that :(

\section{HIP}

Sadly, the problems do not end here. I also tried to implement this by following the slides (pages 3 and 4 of slide set B) very precicely. My attempt can be found in the file 2.cpp in the git repository. This just ended in a Segmentation Fault however, so I fear that this time I am fully at fault. Again here, I did not find the time to fix this problem.\\

Sadly this also means that I do not have any (relevant) plots or comparisons to show for this one. Again, in the git repository is a theoretical benchmark file (csmca_2(broken).py) that I figure would work if the code would work in general.
